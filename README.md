# Quiz 8 - Imaging and Coding Technique Exploration

## Part 1:Imaging Technique Inspiration
I was inspired by the futuristic urban overlooks in the movie Cloud Atlas: the city is like an electronic circuit board with a shimmering grid of light, a clear structure and a strong sense of rhythm. This visual language reminds me of Piet Mondrian's Broadway Boogie Woogie, which uses colored squares and grids to express the rhythm of the city. Inspired by this, I would like to borrow Mondrian's graphic style, using rectangles and three primary colors to depict the sense of order and dynamic rhythm of digital urban space.

## Part 2: Coding Technique Exploration
To achieve the Mondrian style image effect, I use rect(), fill(), noStroke() functions from p5.js. The for loop generates regularly arranged colored rectangles on the canvas, and combines with random() to control the local color distribution, simulating the visual rhythm of the urban grid. This method is easy to operate, in line with the content of the course, and can not only restore the classic style of composition, but also reflect the sense of technological futurism inspired by Cloud Atlas, which is an effective fusion of technology and concepts.
